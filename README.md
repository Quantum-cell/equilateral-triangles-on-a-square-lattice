An equilateral triangle cannot be accurately drawn on a square lattice or grid with all its vertices resting on lattice points. Similarly, representing a cube perfectly on a square lattice is also not possible because the cube's vertices exist in three-dimensional space while the lattice is confined to a two-dimensional plane. Consequently, any depiction of a cube on a square lattice will involve some degree of approximation or distortion of its shape.

Although it is feasible to draw a representation of a cube on a square lattice or grid, the vertices of the cube will not align precisely with lattice points. Therefore, connecting three non-collinear vertices of this lattice-based cube will not result in an equilateral triangle on the lattice.

However, when considering the representation of a cube, connecting three non-collinear vertices will form an equilateral triangle within the cube itself. If a cube representation on a square lattice IS achieved with the vertices resting on lattice points, (i.e. you've just went and drawn a cube by connecting dots on square-dotted paper and you're happy with saying it IS a cube) the resulting triangle from connecting three non-collinear vertices of this cube would also have lattice points as vertices. It is important to note that while this triangle may not visually appear perfectly equilateral due to the limitations of the representation, it can be considered an equilateral triangle within the context of the cube's representation.

While we can assign meaning to these representations and treat them as analogues, shadows or visual approximations of cubes and equilateral triangles, it's important to acknowledge the inherent differences and constraints imposed by the medium of representation. Therefore, it's more accurate to describe such representations as "approximate cubes" and "approximate equilateral triangles" on a square lattice rather than asserting that they are mathematically equivalent to their ideal counterparts.
