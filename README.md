It is not possible to draw an equilateral triangle on a square lattice or grid such that all its vertices are on lattice points. 

Connecting three non-collinear vertices of a cube forms an equilateral triangle within the cube. If we can draw a representation of a cube on a square lattice or grid, where the vertices sit on lattice points, we can connect three non-collinear vertices of this cube to draw a representation of an equilateral triangle where the vertices sit on lattice points. The triangle will not Look equilateral, but will be by virtue of it belonging to the cube.

In fact, it is not possible to perfectly represent a cube on a square lattice or grid such that all its vertices lie on lattice points. This is because the vertices of a cube are located at points in 3D space, and the points of a square lattice or grid only exist in a 2D plane. Therefore, any representation of a cube on a square lattice will involve some approximation or distortion of the cube's shape.

So, while it is possible to draw a representation of a cube on a square lattice or grid, the vertices of the cube will not sit exactly on lattice points, and therefore connecting three non-collinear vertices of this cube will not necessarily form an equilateral triangle on the lattice.

But it can be said to be a representation of an equilateral triangle, as much as the representaiion of the cube is acceptable. Within the context of the cube's representation, the triangle can be considered as an equilateral triangle, even if it may not appear perfectly equilateral due to the limitations of the representation.
